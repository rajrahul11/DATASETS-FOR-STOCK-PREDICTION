The Google Analyst
JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterates an Overweight rating on Alphabet, with a price target of $200 by December 2024. Anmuth highlights Google’s aggressive pace in AI innovation, which he believes will overshadow short-term setbacks.

This move could allow GTI to list on a major exchange, leveraging Boston Beer's legal status.
Additionally, it could facilitate GTI's entry into the growing market for Hemp THC beverages, which are eroding alcohol sales.

According to the Wall Street Journal, GTI sent a letter to Boston Beer on Sunday to discuss a potential merger. GTI has not commented on the reports, and Boston Beer has remained silent. This development follows reports of Japanese whisky maker Suntory being in early talks for a possible acquisition of Boston Beer, which Boston Beer denied. GTI's CEO claims a superior offer could be made compared to Suntory's.

CPI And FOMC Ahead
Please click here for an enlarged chart of iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ: TLT).
Note the following:

The direction of bonds tomorrow will likely determine the direction of the stock market.
The chart shows TLT is below the low band of the resistance zone.
The chart shows that going into important data, volume has stayed low, indicating lack of conviction.
Volume in S&P 500 has also stayed low, indicating lack of conviction ahead of the data.
If bonds approach the mini support zone, then stocks will fall.  If bonds return to the resistance zone, then stocks will fly.
Bonds will move on a rare data day tomorrow – both Consumer Price Index (CPI) and FOMC rate decision will be released.
CPI will be released at 8:30 am ET.  Here are the details:

The consensus for the headline CPI is 0.1%.
The consensus for the core CPI is 0.3%.


The Fed is meeting today and tomorrow.  The Fed will announce its rate decision tomorrow at 2pm ET, followed by Powell’s press conference at 2:30pm ET.
The current consensus is that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged.  The CPI data could influence the Fed’s decision as the data will be released during the FOMC meeting.

One analyst shared his take on the latest events and recent share offering.
What Happened: Over the past 30 days, GameStop completed two at-the-market offerings, selling batches of 45 million and 75 million shares.
The most recent sale of 75 million shares raised $2.137 billion, which translated to an average share price of $28.50.
Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter criticizes the sale price in a recent investor note.
""Given that GameStop's share price closed at $46 on June 6, we had assumed it would complete the sale at an average price of $40. Instead, the shares declined precipitously on June 7, reflecting news from Reddit following a rambling presentation by Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill),"" Pachter said.
The analyst has an Underperform rating and lowered the price target from $13.50 to $11.
Pachter said the new price target reflected the ""lower-than-expected proceeds from the share offering."" The analyst estimated GameStop had around $9.50 per share in net cash.
On Wednesday, Citron Research also announced it was no longer short GameStop.
""It's not because we believe in a turnaround for the company fundamentals will ever happen, but with $4 billion in the bank, they have enough runway to appease their cult-like shareholders,"" Citron's Andrew Left tweeted.

The Key Proposals: There are multiple proposals shareholders were asked to vote on ahead of the meeting including changing its corporate home to Texas and confirming the 2018 CEO pay package for Elon Musk that was voided by a judge earlier this year.
""The 2018 CEO pay package required Elon to deliver transformative and unprecedented growth to earn any compensation. It was a big risk, and many thought that the plan's targets for benefits to stockholders were simply unachievable,"" Tesla said.
The company highlighted the impressive progress and gains made over the last five-plus years.
""Elon delivered: Tesla's stockholders have benefitted from unprecedented growth under Elon's leadership and Tesla has met every single of the 2018 CEO pay package's targets.""

(NASDAQ:NVDA) rally continues, with the stock firmer in premarket trading. It remains to be seen if the concentrated tech strength could be strong enough to lift the broader market.
The market could also receive a shot in the arm from FedEx Corp.’s (NYSE:FDX) positive earnings and M&A rumors.
The Federal Reserve’s favorite inflation gauge, more Fed speeches, consumer sentiment data and durables goods order are among the key reports due on Thursday and Friday. More importantly, traders may also focus on the presidential debate that is scheduled for late Thursday.

Therefore, traders may focus on each incoming evidence to make sense of its implication for rates.
In Tuesday’s session, the spotlight is likely to be on bond yields, the results of the JOLTS report and monthly sales from automakers, including Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA). Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech could be another closely-watched catalyst.

(NASDAQ:RIVN) has been gaining investor interest in the past week, mostly due to a major investment by German automaker Volkswagen in the latter part of June. But there is more to the company’s attempts at achieving profitability.
Financial Shape: Rivian, despite its R1 vehicle offerings that have been well received, is yet to turn a profit. The company has been accumulating losses for every vehicle it delivered until the first quarter of 2024 when it made a loss of nearly $39,000 for each of the 13,588 vehicles it sold.
While this is a significant loss to incur on a vehicle starting at roughly $70,000, it is still lower than the first quarter of 2023 when it incurred a loss of about $67,000 on every vehicle it delivered.
The company, until recently, was looking to scale production to bring down losses. In the third quarter of 2023, the company sold over 15,000 vehicles and recorded a loss of about $31,000 on each, the least quarterly loss per delivery recorded by the company. 
However, for 2024, Rivian expects to make only 57,000 vehicles, largely in line with its production rate last year when it produced 57,232 vehicles and delivered 50,122.

Race To Profitability: Rivian is looking to turn its first-ever quarterly gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2024. The latest in its strategy is the announcement of its intent to form a joint venture with Volkswagen aimed at creating software-defined vehicle platforms to be used in both players' future electric vehicles starting in the second half of the decade.
